## Better World

## Context

The world is a mess right now. With so many systemic problems facing us today, we need to empower more people to work towards a creating a better world for their communities and future generations. 

Over a three month project through a class on [Persuasive Design](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/18486), our team researched how persuasive techniques and technology could help. 

TL:DR
We found that the nebulous and long term goals of activist work made it difficult for many groups to maintain engagement and stay focused on their mission. So we came up with a platform that utilized numerous pursuasive technques to keep the activist group members motivated, coordinated, and focused. In the process, we conducted __X__ user interviews, created an MVP of the platform in Figma and went through 4 rounds of user testing and interation.

## Process

We followed the traditional Design Thinking framework of Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test.

### Empathize

**Initial Problem Space**
We are more isolated from our local communities than ever before. At a time when we need to come together to try and address the issues we're facing, we are less connected to those around us. 

During our initial research phase, we started with the broad question of:

**How might we utilize persuasive techniques to strengthen and support community engagement?**

**Initial Target User**
We initially decided to target recent college graduates who moved to new cities after graduating. We wanted to better understand the relationship they had with thier new communities and their interests in forming closer communities.

## Process

We followed the traditional Design Thinking framework of Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test.

### Empathize

**Initial Problem Space**
* Make connections between people through shared advocacy/activism goals
* Helping the larger community by bringing a smaller group together and sending them off to work on community based projects. 
* How to help Community-based orgs recruit and maintain engagement with the community? (Civic Engagement)
* Getting people together to do community projects (like restoring wetlands/natural areas, trail projects) -- Civic engagement (Crosses into sustainable behaviors)
* How do you find communities within your own that are in need of help?
Children, elderly, disabled, homeless, etc.
* How can you reduce bias in who gets help?
* How do you find and encourage community service groups?

**Initial Target User**
Discussion -- College students/Recent grads? A perfect time in their lives (the good pivot point) for forming some platform or opportunity for creating a community and learning more about what they are interested in and possibly getting involved. 

Recent grads from undergraduate
Transitional period, feeling of displacement
Not graduate because wider range of ages - some are still figuring things out but some are settled with families
Variety: major, background
Similarities: 1-5 years after graduation, moved away from where they went to college (can move back to hometowns because big difference in age from when they originally left)



### Define
After initial rounds of research, our goal is to strengthen and increase engagement of actively participating members in social activist groups by encouraging them to stay involved longer in ways that work for them. Our target users are leaders of organizations for college-aged students in Pittsburgh, with the hope of eventually being able to generalize to all activist organizations. To achieve this, we plan to create a tool, intervention, or system based on theories related to self-affirmation and deindividuation to be used by the leaders in aiding their organizations to maintain engagement among active members. With this in mind, we have unknowns that we plan to clear as we continue conversations with leaders.
