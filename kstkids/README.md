%param=title:Context
%param=content:
Kelly Strayhorn theater is a small contemporary theater in the East Liberty Neightborhood of Pittsburgh. Thier mission is to bring diverse communities together through creative expression. They’ve asked for our help to come up with solutions that address the following 3 areas:
 
##### - How Might We increase participation and donations to the Kelly Strayhorn Theater?
##### - How Might We encourage people to engage with others unlike themselves in order to create shared understanding?
##### - How Might We transform the physical theater experience into a shared online experience?
^^
# Solution

A summer program for young people focused on 
- Fostering passion for the performing arts within this community.
- Creating a ‘virtuous cycle’ of peer support by connecting older participant with younger ones through mentorship and leadership opportunities. 
- Ceaching new audiences and connect families from diverse backgrounds, 

Kelly Strayhorn Theater wants to be a integral part of the East Liberty community. Our research has indicated that a passion for the arts usually develops early in life, especially when the child supported and encouraged by their family, peers, and role models. Kelly Strayhorn Theater is currently expanding thier kid’s programming, so we have highlighted the importance of helping children develop this support network and creating experiences that signal ‘future belongingness,’ motivating them to continue.

# Process
### Background Research
^^BLOCK SplitImage>>
  %param=content: 
  Before we could come up with solutions, we needed to understand KST’s history, their role in the community, and their current approach towards addressing these questions. We also looked more broadly to see how other live entertainment venues are adapting to Covid19.

  %param=caption: Our background research involved better understanding our client’s identity and role in the community and looking at new ways of reaching people during the pandemic.



^^
#### Key Insights: 

- KST’s supportive and inclusive community draws patrons in and differentiates it from attending a traditional performance. They’ve had a hard time recreating this environment online.

- While there is a tension with KST’s mission and values and that of the surrounding neighborhood, KST supports and pushes for social progress. They see performing arts as an agent for social change.

- Much of KST’s funding comes from grants and donors rather than ticket sales. Making art more accessible is a core value of theirs.

### Think Aloud For Generative Research
^^BLOCK SplitImage>>
  %param=content: 
 In order to better understand what students look for in a performing arts program, we conducted a round of **Think-Aloud testing** with a number of 14-17 year olds involved in theater or dance over zoom.

Our goal with this research was to figure out what they were looking for when deciding if a program was the right fit and where they expected that information to be.

  %param=caption: We used the website of Wingspace Theatrical Design for our **Think-Aloud** because their mentorship program fit within the problem space we were focused on.

^^

Key Findings
Users liked seeing candid, unposed pictures of people that were a part of the program. 
“I like the candid pictures, they gave me insight into the types of people she would be interacting with it if she were a part of the program.”

Users want all of the important information about the program on a single page, not scattered across multiple.

“The link to the FAQs page was really easy to miss! I just sort of expected everything to be somewhere on this page”
^^
### Contextual Inquiry, Interpretation Session, and Affinity Diagram 
To learn more about how individuals initially get involved in performing arts and how that initial involvement develops into a passion, we ran artifact analysis contextual inquiry interviews. 

We asked participants to prepare artifacts such as a picture, video, or playbill that came from:
- Something that sparked their interest in theater/dance 
- Something associated with their first performance 
- Something that represents their theater community 

By having the particpants recount these early experiences. we gained a much deeper understanding into what motivated them to get involved and form an identity around performing arts. 

After completing the interview, we ran an interpretation session, where we wrote all our insights on notes in Miro. We then grouped these inights by theme to create an affinity diagram.

### Key Insights

**How are artists introduced to to performing arts?**

**Insight**
If they get involved at young age, their parents are the ones that introduce and encourage them to continue. If they are older, close friends who’re already involved in performing arts are more likely to encourage their involvement.

**Evidence**
“I got involved largely because my parents pushed me that way. I stayed involved because I was super excited about performing and had friends involved and older ppl to look up to”
“My mom was really supportive. She encouraged me to do it [dance] even if I was nervous.”


**What motivates them to continue?**

**Insight**
Support from parents, peers, and role models play a critical role in motivating them to continue. Signals of ‘future belongingness’ like getting a lead role they didn’t expect to get or being brought up to perform in a more professional productions also were extremely powerful.

**Evidence**
“The strong bond I had between one of my friends helped convinced me to stay in it. Many people dropped out because other things became priorities.”
“I looked up to older dancers and saw them wearing [pointe shoes] and thought what they were doing was really impressive. I could imagine myself doing it in the future and was driven to keep going.”

### Speed Dating and Storyboarding

As we moved closer to the solution stage of the process, we wanted to better understand the specific needs of the potential users. We planned to use a research methodology called Speed Dating to probe further into the user needs we discovered and come up with potential areas to focus our solution on. Before conducting the speed dating, we had to come up with storyboards targeting various needs.

We performed another “Walk the Wall” to look for signs of these specific user needs. Then we came up with a wide range of storyboards on these needs by holding a Crazy 8’s Session, during which, each team member came up with eight storyboards within an eight-minute period. After discussing our storyboards the needs we were targeting with each one, we voted on top storyboards to chose 4 user needs to focus on in the speed dating sessions.

**Top User Needs**
1. Parent’s investment
2. Recognition outside of the theater 
3. Internal supportive culture (peers, mentors, etc)
4. Address mental health, self-esteem, individual growth


We then developed 12 storyboards, 3 connected to each user need. Then, we recruited four participants aged 12-18 involved in performing arts to give us their thoughts on each of the scenarios. We probed further into each response to better understand the extent and severity of the need.

Below is an example of one of the storyboards related to mental health.

^^
## Prototyping

The research validated our assumptions that targeting students could be an effective way to increase participation, reach new audiences, and positively affect the community. During the prototyping stage, we turned these insight into a concrete solution that KST could implement.

As part of our effort to figure out ways to engage the community with theater, we focused on developing a summer performing arts program for students of various ages, from young children around age 6 up to teenagers around age 17 to attend. We decided that the best way to get feedback on the idea was to walk them through the scenario of finding and looking into the program. Through this approach, we could probe into what would convince the potential participants to sign up for the program and what they’re expectations would be for it. The instagram ad and poster helped us discover what type of content would engage the target audience and the website helped us learn about what they’d hope to get out of it.
^^
## Presenting
After incroporating the feedback into our final design, we prepared a poster and pitch to present Stakeholders from Kelly Strayhorn Theater. We demonstrated that the there was an oppurtunity to foster the inclusive environment, reach new audiences, and encourage continued involvement in the arts by creating a summer performing arts program.
